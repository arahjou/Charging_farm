## Charging Farm
This repository contains the necessary files for 3D printing the charging unit for the **Actilumus (Condor)** device, along with instructions on how to build it.

I used **PLA filament** to print all parts. After soldering the components, the connections were secured with hot glue. The pins were also fixed in place after being soldered onto a **PCB board**.

### **Charging**

After connecting all of your devices to 3D-printed charging docks and while they are charging, you can manage all of your devices in the software by connecting **one official charging dock** to your computer.

This way, your computer will automatically recognize all connected devices, allowing you to **sync, read, delete**, and perform other actions.

**⚠️ Warning:** Before using the device, connect your 3D-printed device to the charger and check the voltage, polarity (positive and negative), and current (amperage). The readings should be similar to what you get from a USB port on a computer.
