## Charging Farm

This repository contains the necessary files for 3D printing the charging unit for the **Actilumus (Condor)** device. In addition to 

I used **PLA filament** to print all parts. After soldering the components, the connections were secured with hot glue. The pins were also fixed in place after being soldered onto a **PCB board**.
